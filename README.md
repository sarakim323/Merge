Merge is an IOS mobile app that allows users to store their medical records in one place. User can add a basic health profile, keep track of routine health screenings history, and compile a list of healthcare providers. As a part of the Hack Reactor program, the goal of this project was to build a minimum viable product in 72 hours. Some additional features that will be implemented in the future include the following:
- a family account that can have up to 5 individual profiles
- a section to add medical records (lab results, immunization records, office visit notes, etc.) sorted by category
